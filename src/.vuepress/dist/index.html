That's exactly what Web3.0, or Web3, is doing. It's re-imagining the web!</em></p></li> <li><p><em>When we talk about the ‚Äúopen web‚Äù we are talking about a system in which users have both freedom and transparency. As opposed to the &quot;closed&quot; systems used by certain governments to limit free access to information, the open web is designed to be a cooperative effort among a community of users and builders</em></p></li> <li><p><em>Why is Web3 so powerful and important? Because it has the ability to side-step centralized power structures that govern the internet. Web3 is all about open access to information with a level of privacy not attainable previously. Getting around Big Brother is a pretty big deal, isn‚Äôt it?</em></p></li> <li><p><em>Why is it called Web3? Today, Web3 generally refers to a type of network consisting of many smaller networks that is still accessed through the existing internet, but with very different rules. Until Web3 fully breaks away from centralization, we can think of it and its infrastructure as another type of highway (like web2.0), but one where the toll roads pay YOU!</em></p></li></ul> <hr> <ol><li><strong>You and NEAR Protocol</strong> üöÄ</li></ol> <div class="asset-container"><img src="/images/course/near_layers.jpeg" alt="NEAR"></div> <ul><li><p><em>It's an exciting time for Web3.

Pretty much everything in Web3 can be accessed through a modern browser.</em></p></li> <li><p><em>NEAR Protocol is no different - it's a system of distributed networks with its own rules, or <strong>protocol</strong>, for communicating, but it's accessible to anyone through any modern browser.</em></p></li> <li><p><em>If you are eager to learn more about all this, then click the &quot;Start Course&quot; button below to get started!</em></p></li></ul> <hr> <div class="footer-link"><p class="actions"><a href="/computer/" aria-label="Start Course" class="nav-link action-button primary">Start Course</a></p></div></div> <div class="footer">
